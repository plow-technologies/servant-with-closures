# servant-with-closures

[This file](https://github.com/plow-technologies/servant-with-closures/blob/master/src/ServantClosures/Internal/Closure.hs)

contains a sample implementation of a remoteTable with servant.

Because servant can generate both the client and server side API it makes sense to be used with
distributed process style closures.

This repo is a sketch of how such a thing might be done.
